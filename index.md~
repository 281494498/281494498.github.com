##Project in May

###using HTML template to generate pages
- Like using [EJS](http://embeddedjs.com/), but it is just too simple to use, not recommeded by `single page web application p207`
- using handlerbar.js(mustache.js), it cost about 120k, but with [hogan.js](http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/), it only cost 2.5k 
- last very popular way is to use jadeJs, which is defaultly embedded into node.js, also be supported natively by webstorm

###Markdown is a good language to simply write something
- markdown file is the most used text file in github,  which has a suffix of `md`
- [Wikipedia](http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [Github](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics) have clear explanation, plus there are quick introduction [here](http://jianshu.io/p/q81RER)
